# Linear Search

>  ***Linear search*** is a simple algorithm used to find the position of a target value within a list or array. It checks each element in sequence until the target is found or the list ends.

#### <u>Characteristics of Linear Search</u>

* Time Complexity: O(n) — in the worst case, you may need to check every element.

* Space Complexity: O(1) — it uses a constant amount of extra space.

* Best For: Small arrays or unsorted data, where other search algorithms may not be efficient.
